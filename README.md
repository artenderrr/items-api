# About
This project is a simple **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built with **FastAPI**. It provides functionality for managing abstract items and serves as a platform to explore and improve various skills related to API development.

## What I Learned
- 🚀 Building simple APIs with FastAPI and understanding its core features.
- 📝 Enhancing OpenAPI documentation for better clarity and usability.
- 🧪 Writing and executing basic API tests using `pytest`.
- ✨ Ensuring type safety with `mypy` to catch potential bugs early.
